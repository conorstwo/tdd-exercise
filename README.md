**How to run the application**
To run the application open Application.java and enter the items you wish to add to the basket in the main method as directed. 
Running the main method will print the contents of the basket and the total cost.

A future improvement could be to take input from the user via a Scanner to add items the shopping basket but this is omitted to focus on the core calculating functionality.
